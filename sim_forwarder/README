src/                 # GPL additions

errno.h
iso7816_port.h       # generaic uart abstraction
iso7816_slave.h|c    # slave (card) side protocol
iso7816_master.c     # master (reader) side protocol
iso7816_at91.c       # AT91 uart code (implements iso7816_port.h)
usb_control_at91.h|c # AT91 USB VENDOR control request handling

mim.py               # simple MiTM setup: connect slave side to card reader
*.py                 # support code for mim.py

iso7816-slave-cdc-project/main.c  # firmware entry point


Basic ideas:
- Keep slave side simple so it can be shared with card OS
- Implement slave side as non-blocking state machine to avoid dependency on RTOS
- Export slave interface over USB VENDOR control requests



Issues
------

- The USB VENDOR interface is currently bolted on top of a dummy
  virtual CDC serial port application.  The CDC serial port
  functionality is not used.

  I was not able to merge this code with the CCID driver.

  That said, the APDU forwarder functionality does work for me using a
  separate off-the-shelf USB card reader.  Entry points:
  src/mim.py
  iso7816-slave-cdc-project/main.c


- I was not able to get the CCID driver code to work properly.  The
  apdu_phone branch contains some fixes wrt Harald's master branch,
  but I am not able to get a correct ATR from the card in the reader
  slot.




Fixing it up 
-------------

It doesn't look like I'm going to have time to finish this up.

I'm happy to assist anyone that wants to tackle it.  It is hard to
estimate at this point how much time it would take.

The problem is one of design: the structure of the Atmel CCID driver
is not suited to be extended to support the asynchronous iso7816 slave
driver:

- CCID driver uses interrupts for USB, and HW blocking serial I/O

- iso7816 code uses non-blocking / polled mode.

If I were to fix this, I would switch everything to the same
mechanism:
a) interrupt/DMA for everything, or
b) non-blocking polling state machines for everything or
c) use an RTOS with support for AT91 USB / serial

It might be possible to hack it in such a way that a big change is not
necessary.  I tried this in usb-device-ccid-project/main.c with
corresponding modifications to cciddriver.c, but I don't see clearly
why it doesn't work.  It might be as simple as a serial port
initialization bug.
